### Final Project
Results and the workflow are shown in ```./SAS System - Data Analytics Project Report```.

We collect the data of smart bracelets worn by the whole class and analyze the correlation between sleep quality and life based on the data. There are about 120 classmates in the class. We analized the correlation between age, stress, average heart rate, exercise status (steps), blood oxygen concentration and sleep status (deep sleep/light sleep/REM/awake). Also, we attach medical scientific research materials as supporting evidences and visualized the results in different charts.
